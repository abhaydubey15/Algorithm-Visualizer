# Algorithm-Visualizer
Algorithm Visualizer is a web-based tool that allows you to interactively explore various algorithms, including sorting algorithms and Binary Search Tree (BST) operations. With this project, you can gain a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work by visualizing their step-by-step execution.

#Features
Sorting Algorithms:

Visualize and compare popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort. Understand their time complexity and performance differences.

Bubble Sort
Quick Sort
Merge Sort
Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations:

Explore Binary Search Trees by inserting, deleting, and searching for nodes. Visualize how the BST evolves with each operation.

Insertion
Deletion
Search
Traversal (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
Path Finding Algorithms:

Dijkstra's Algorithm
A* Search Algorithm
BFS
DFS
Interactive Interface: User-friendly interface that allows you to control the speed of visualization, step through the algorithm's execution, and pause or reset at any time.

Custom Data: Input your own data sets and see how algorithms behave with real-world data.

Educational: Use this tool for educational purposes, whether you're a student learning algorithms or a teacher explaining them to others.
